	This is the sample RFID data provided by the Ministry in the hackathon website. 
	It contains employee id, date, time stamp and the IN-OUT status in a csv format.
	Let us see how this data is derived...
	BARC employees use their IDs to mark the attendance. 
	Then they have to press the IN/OUT Button to mark the status in the database.
	Otherwise no data will be added. If anyone forgot to press the IN button with in some time, then they will be marked 'absent'.
	They don't need to worry about the OUT status as it is optional.
	All such regulations and dataset descriptons are not explained in the hackathon website. 
	We got it from our college alumnus @Mr.Kathick, who is working at BARC in operational area..(NSS) 

	We developed the application "R-PAD" in R , which is a powerful statistical computing language primarily used for data analytics.
	The app would provide data about the Outliers, Defaulters and also monitor the Attendance.
	</img src = "R-PAD">
	The Shiny framework of R is used to develop this web application.
	<div label = "Working of the application"> 
		The user can upload the data file here..
		Once the file gets uploaded, the file is pre processed to the required format in the backend. 
		Data Analytics of the pre processed data is done in the R server.
		In the Outliers tab, we can get the list of Late Comers and Early Goers and if you need to download the data, you can!
		This Box Plot clearly shows, Employees are only late during the IN and early upon exit..
		The Defaulters tab list the employees those who marked the IN status but not Out status here and the inverse is displayed here.
		Attendace list with presentees and absentees are viewed here.
		We developed this app as a reactive one..
		So if you modify the date here, this pie chart and the employees list will update.
		This date Range is applicable for Outliers and Defaulters. 
		Currently the date range finds only the outliers of 1/1/16 and if we extend this, we will get a new updated list and the plots.
		Performance Tab is Comming soon! It is under construction..
		If the user gives the employe id, it will show his performance based on the attendance, outliers and defaulters data.
		We are also planning to display the 'Top 5 Performers of the week/month' in reactive to the input date range.
